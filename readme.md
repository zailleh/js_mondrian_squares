# Mondrian Squares
This project is a attempt to use coding to find the lowest possible score for a given square in the Mondrian Squares riddle.

## The Goal
In a Mondria Square puzzle, the aim is to divide a square with rectangles, covering the area of the entire square, without using the same size rectangle more than once. The score is calculated by taking the rectangle with the largest area and subtracting the area of the smallest rectange. The goal is to get the smallest possible score. To do this, you want to use rectangles that are similar in area.
